** Skipping "packageName" in Console output
*** If your output resembles:
Skipping tidyrSkipping roxygen2Skipping purrrSkipping broomSkipping foreignSkipping rJavaSkipping
*** This means that you already have these packages. 
The (re-)downloading of these packages is skipped on your installation.
They are still "loaded" via require(packageName) or library(packageName).
